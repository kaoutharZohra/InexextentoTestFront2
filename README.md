## Front End Test part 2 
This is a simple react application that allows the user to introduce a "user name" in an input than launch a research to fetch his github repo.
### Instructions:
- clone 
- cd 
- npm install
- npm start 

### About the code 
- To develop this application, I used react hooks: List of Cards,a Form and the App.
- For the http request I used axios get request.
